The Cachedump folder contains the scripts and the results for the Image-level size analysis. To run it, however, you will need the following folders from Muhammad Server:

1. merged_raw 
2. webp_files
3. avif_files

All 3 folders can be accessed at: (base) muhammad@muhammad-HP-Z230-Tower-Workstation:~/Desktop/imagesWebOptimzations/conversion$
